    <h1>Projects</h1>

    <!-- Professional Experience -->
    <section id="professional" class="project-card reflection-box">
      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>My professional experience demonstrates leadership, teamwork, and adaptability. 
      As a Ticket Office Supervisor for Mizzou Athletics, I managed student staff, assisted with game-day operations, and ensured quality service. 
      During my internship with Brown &amp; Root Industrial Services, I gained insight into project management, scheduling, and operations support. 
      At Starbucks, I strengthened my time management and communication skills in a fast-paced environment.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Academic Projects -->
    <section id="academic" class="project-card reflection-box">
      <h2>Academic Projects</h2>
      <p>Through my General Studies program at the University of Missouri, I’ve explored courses in Mathematics, Engineering, and Industrial Engineering that taught me to think critically and analytically. 
      My coursework has focused on process improvement, systems efficiency, and data-driven decision-making. 
      These projects developed my problem-solving abilities and attention to structure, helping me connect theory with real-world applications.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Creative Work -->
    <section id="creative" class="project-card reflection-box">
      <h2>Creative Work</h2>
      <p>Beyond academics and work, I channel creativity through pyrography—wood-burning art that allows for detailed, hands-on expression. 
      I also enjoy reading and curating creative content inspired by storytelling and aesthetics. 
      These projects reflect balance and patience, the same qualities I bring into my professional and academic work.</p>
