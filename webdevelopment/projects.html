        <h2>Ticket Office Supervisor – Mizzou Athletics</h2>
        <p>
          At the Mizzou Athletics ticket office, I supervised student workers and handled event operations. 
          I trained new employees, handled cash, and worked with customers during busy game days. 
          This role gave me leadership experience and taught me how to help a team work effectively.

        <h2>Project Management Intern – Brown &amp; Root Industrial Services</h2>
        <p>
          As a project management intern, I assisted with project documentation and communication. 
          A lot of my work was keeping schedules updated, working in Excel, and communicating between the office, the contractor, and the field. 
          This gave me a better understanding of how projects operate from start to finish and how valuable open communication is.

        <h2>Barista – Starbucks</h2>
        <p>
          I currently work as a barista at Starbucks, where I’ve learned how to handle a fast-paced environment while working as part of a team. 
          This job has taught me to adapt quickly, manage multiple responsibilities at once, and stay calm during busy rushes. 
          It has also helped me build strong communication skills with both customers and coworkers, which connects well to future roles in operations or project management.

        <h2>Creative Project – Pyrography</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy pyrography, which is a form of wood-burning art. 
          I create designs on wooden slabs, and the process requires patience, focus, and attention to detail. 
          This project is very different from my academic and work experiences because there isn’t one “right” answer. 
          Every piece turns out unique, and that has taught me to slow down, be patient, and step away from perfectionism. 
          Pyrography gives me a creative outlet and shows another side of me beyond school and work.
