    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here you can find my academic work, job experiences,
      and projects that represent me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My site is an introduction of who I am and what I bring to the table.
      It highlights my education, work, and project experience. I am pursuing a
      Bachelor of General Studies degree with concentrations in mathematics,
      industrial engineering, and engineering. I also feature my work experiences
      and explain what I have learned from them, such as leadership, teamwork,
      and adaptability. To show a little of my personal side, I include one creative
      project—pyrography—because it shows detail and creativity. The goal of my
      home page is to give future employers a strong first impression and make them
      want to learn more about me through the rest of my site.
