    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p>Through my General Studies program at the University of Missouri, I’ve learned to approach challenges from several perspectives. Mathematics strengthened my ability to analyze data and solve problems logically, while engineering courses taught me how systems connect and how design decisions affect efficiency. These experiences shaped how I organize information and find practical solutions.</p>

    <h2>Work Experiences</h2>
    <p>Working in the Mizzou Athletics ticket office gave me firsthand leadership and communication experience. I trained other student workers, balanced customer service with problem solving, and managed time during high-pressure events. My internship with Brown &amp; Root showed me how project schedules, documentation, and teamwork come together to meet deadlines. Starbucks taught me how important flexibility and teamwork are in fast-paced settings.</p>

    <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
    <p>Outside of school and work, I’ve grown through creative outlets like pyrography and reading. Wood-burning art helps me slow down and focus on detail, teaching patience and acceptance of imperfection. Reading gives me perspective and a way to recharge. Both hobbies remind me to maintain balance and creativity in my daily life.</p>

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
  <p>I plan to pursue project or operations management roles that combine organization, design, and communication. My goal is to build systems that help teams work efficiently while supporting balance and creativity. I hope to continue learning, growing, and applying what I’ve learned in both academic and professional settings to create meaningful, sustainable results.</p>
