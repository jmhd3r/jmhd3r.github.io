     <!-- bio paragraphs -->
    <p>Hello, my name is Jasmine Hill, and I am a senior at the University of Missouri.
      I plan to graduate in May 2026 with a Bachelor of General Studies, concentrating
      in mathematics, industrial engineering, and engineering. My degree path has
      strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me how to look at systems
      from different perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>I have gained a lot from my work experience during college. At the Mizzou
      Athletics ticket office, I worked as a supervisor, which helped me grow in
      leadership and customer service. My internship with Brown & Root Industrial
      Services gave me project management experience and showed me how important
      communication is for keeping projects on track. My current role as a Starbucks
      barista has helped me learn teamwork and flexibility in a fast-paced environment. 
    </p>
    <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy pyrography and reading. These creative hobbies
      push me to be more patient and less focused on perfect answers, since creativity
      looks different every time.
    </p>
